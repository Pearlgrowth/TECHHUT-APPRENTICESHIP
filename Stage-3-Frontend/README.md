# GitHub Profile Card Challenge

Recreate a GitHub-style profile card using the provided design and JSON data. This challenge is divided into two levels — a basic layout implementation and an advanced interactive editing experience(optional).

## Objective

Build a **responsive GitHub profile card** that dynamically displays user data from a JSON file and optionally supports **editing** via a form.

## What's Included

```bash
 assets/           # icons, images
 designs/          # JPG previews (mobile + desktop)
 data/
   └── profile.json  # Sample profile data
 README.md         # Task instructions
 style-guide.md    # Colors, fonts, spacing guidelines
```

# Your Tasks

This challenge is divided into two parts. Complete the basic version first, then optionally level up with the interactive edit feature.

## Level 1 – Basic Implementation

- Load profile data from `data/profile.json`
- Build the layout to match the provided design (desktop + mobile)
- Use the correct fonts, colors, and spacing from `style-guide.md`
- Ensure the design is fully responsive
- Include all visible elements

## Level 2 – Edit Functionality (Optional)

- When the **Edit** button is clicked, show a form page.
- The form should allow updating these fields:
  - Name
  - Username
  - Bio
  - Website
  - Location
- On submission:
  - The profile card updates in real-time with new values
- Return to the profile card view after form submission
